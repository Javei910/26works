# Visual Philosophy: Alchemical Art Nouveau
The style must blend the "Shadow" (darkness, depth, subconscious) with "Somatic Growth" (botanical life, roots, blooming). 

## 1. Core Aesthetic Rules
- **Line Work**: Use "whiplash curves" and thick-to-thin organic lines characteristic of Alphonse Mucha.
- **Framing**: Every major exercise page must have an ornate botanical border. Vines, thorns, and roots should "grow" into the text area.
- **Somatic Mapping**: When representing the body (silhouettes), the "organs" or "pain points" should be represented by flowers or fungi (e.g., anxiety in the chest = a tangled briar patch; peace in the belly = a blooming lily).
- **Shadow Contrast**: Use high-contrast silhouettes. The "Shadow Self" is a dark, solid shape, while the "Integrated Self" is filled with intricate botanical patterns.

## 2. Color Palette (The Alchemical Garden)
- **Primary**: Deep Charcoal (#1A1A1A) and Aged Parchment (#F4F1EA).
- **Accents**: Muted Sage Green, Dusty Rose, and Metallic Gold line work.
- **Shadow Tones**: Ink-wash textures for areas representing the unconscious.

## 3. Botanical Symbolism
- **The Inner Child**: Unfolding ferns, snowdrops, or seeds.
- **Fear/Anxiety**: Thistle, nightshade, or strangler vines.
- **Integration/Healing**: Irises, lotuses, or rising saplings.
- **Ancestral Work**: Deep, gnarled oak roots or mycelium networks.

## 4. Prompt Engineering Standard
When asked to generate an image prompt for this book, always append this suffix:
> "In the style of Art Nouveau lithography, Alphonse Mucha and Ernst Haeckel. Intricate botanical line art, high contrast, alchemical symbolism, muted earth tones with gold filigree, symmetrical composition, 8k resolution, print-ready engraving style."

## 5. Constraints
- NO 3D renders or photorealistic elements.
- NO modern geometric shapes (circles must be hand-drawn/organic).
- NO bright neon colors.
- Maintain a "vintage journal" feel, as if the book was found in a 19th-century library.
