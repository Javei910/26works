  body_text: [
    Imagine your psyche as a vast garden. Some areas are well-tended, bathed in sunlight—these are the parts of yourself you show the world. But there are other corners: overgrown thickets, deep caves, and composting piles.
    
    These shadier spots are not "bad." In fact, it is often in the dark, nutrient-rich soil of the shadow that our deepest growth occurs.
    
    This journal is a lantern. It will not destroy the shadows, but it will help you see what lives there. You may find monsters you feared were real are merely shadows cast by a small object. You may find treasures you buried long ago.
