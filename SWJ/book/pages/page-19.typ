    The people who trigger you the most are often your greatest teachers. They are mirrors, reflecting back the parts of yourself you have disowned.
    
    *Projection* is a defense mechanism where we unconsciously attribute our own unacceptable qualities, emotions, or desires to others. When you hate someone's arrogance, ask yourself: where am I arrogant? When you resent someone's neediness, ask: where am I needy?
    
    Turn external irritations into internal insights using somatic trigger tracking and the 3-2-1 process. Reclaim the energy you've unconsciously projected onto the world around you.
