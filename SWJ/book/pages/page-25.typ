    Fear has a physical address. For many, it lives in the belly—the "butterflies," the churning, the knot. For others, it is a tightness in the chest, a lump in the throat, or shaking hands.
    
    Close your eyes. Bring to mind something you fear. Let the sensation arise without judgment.

    *Mark the figure above:*
    - Draw THISTLE or NIGHTSHADE where fear lives
    - Draw STRANGLER VINES where anxiety constricts your breath
    - Draw ROOTS where you can still find grounding
    
    Remember: fear is not the enemy. It is data. What is it trying to tell you?
