    Before we descend into the depths, we must first learn to hold ourselves.
    
    Shadow work can stir powerful emotions—old grief, forgotten rage, hidden shame. Without a sense of safety, these feelings can overwhelm the nervous system and send us into freeze, fight, or flight.
    
    This phase is about building your *Safety Container*: a set of somatic tools and rituals that help you regulate your nervous system, so you can explore the dark without getting lost in it.
    
    Master the art of nervous system regulation and build a clinical-grade safety container before the deep work begins. This is where you learn to self-soothe so you never have to dig alone.
