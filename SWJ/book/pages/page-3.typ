    Welcome to The Felt Sense Shadow Work Journal.
    
    This book is an invitation to explore the hidden parts of yourself—the parts that have been cast into the shadows, yet hold immense power and potential. Shadow work is not about fixing what is broken, but about integrating what has been forgotten.
    
    As you move through these pages, you will be guided to gently uncover the patterns, beliefs, and emotions that operate beneath the surface of your conscious awareness. We will use the body—the felt sense—as our primary compass.
    
    Approach this work with curiosity and compassion. There is no right or wrong way to feel.
