      1.  *Find a quiet space.* Place your hand on the part of your body where fear lives most strongly.
      
      2.  *Greet your fear.* Say aloud: "Hello, Fear. I see you."
      
      3.  *Ask it questions:*
          - "What are you trying to protect me from?"
          - "How long have you been here?"
          - "What do you need from me?"
      
      4.  *Listen.* Write down anything that arises—images, memories, sensations.
      
      5.  *Thank it.* Say: "Thank you for protecting me. I am taking it from here."
