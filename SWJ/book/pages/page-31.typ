    Some emotions are so taboo that we bury them immediately. Rage. Envy. Shame. Hatred. We are taught that "good people" do not feel these things, so we push them into the darkest corners of the shadow.
    
    But these emotions do not disappear. They fester. They leak out as passive aggression, depression, or physical illness. The only way out is through.
    
    Transform "taboo" emotions into high-frequency energy through visceral somatic rituals for rage, envy, and shame. Learn to safely express and release what has been repressed for years.
