    Your Inner Child lives in your body. Often, the places where we hold the most tension are the places where childhood emotions were first stored.
    
    Close your eyes and think of a moment from childhood when you felt rejected, shamed, or silenced.
    
    Where do you feel that memory in your body *right now*?

    *Mark the figure above:*
    - Draw FERNS or SEEDLINGS where you feel your Inner Child's presence
    - Draw SNOWDROPS where you feel tenderness or vulnerability
    - Draw THORNS where childhood wounds still ache
    
    Speak gently to these places. They have been waiting for you.
