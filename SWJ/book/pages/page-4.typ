  title: "A Gentler Approach",
  body_text: [
    Traditionally, shadow work can feel heavy, analytical, or even aggressive—like we are hunting down our flaws to eliminate them. The approach in *The Felt Sense* is different.
    
    We are not here to wage war on ourselves. We are here to listen.
    
    The shadow is not an enemy; it is simply the part of you that had to be hidden away to ensure your survival, acceptance, or safety at some point in your life. It holds not only your "dark" emotions like rage and shame but also your golden shadow: your unexpressed creativity, power, and joy.

    *How to Use This Journal*
    
    This journal is designed to be nonlinear. While there is a structure, trust your intuition. If a particular exercise calls to you, go there. If you need to rest, rest.
    
    We recommend carving out 10–20 minutes of uninterrupted time for each session. Create a ritual around it—light a candle, make tea, or simply take three deep breaths before opening the page.
