    You have completed *The Somatic Shadow Work Journal*.
    
    But this is not an ending—it is a beginning. The shadow does not disappear; it simply becomes a companion instead of an enemy. You will continue to meet new shadows throughout your life. Now, you have the tools.
    
    Return to this journal whenever you need to. The pages will be here. The work continues.
