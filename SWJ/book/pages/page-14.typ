      1.  *Light a candle.* This signals to your nervous system that sacred, boundaried time has begun.
      
      2.  *Place your feet flat on the floor.* Feel the ground beneath you. You are held by the earth.
      
      3.  *Place one hand on your heart, one on your belly.* Say aloud:
      
      #align(center)[
        _"I am safe in this moment.
        I can stop at any time.
        I am the expert on my own experience."_

      4.  *Take three slow breaths.* Inhale for 4, hold for 4, exhale for 6.
      
      5.  *Begin your work.* When finished, blow out the candle to close the container.
