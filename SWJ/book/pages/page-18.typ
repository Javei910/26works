      1.  *Find a photo of yourself as a child* (or simply close your eyes and visualize that child).
      
      2.  *Write a letter to your younger self.* Tell them:
          - What you wish someone had told you
          - That they are not "too much" or "not enough"
          - That they are safe now
      
      3.  *Read the letter aloud.* Speak slowly, as if the child is truly listening.
      
      4.  *Place one hand on your heart.* Feel the warmth of your own presence.
