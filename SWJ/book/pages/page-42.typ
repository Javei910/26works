      1.  *Sit quietly.* Close your eyes. Take 3 deep breaths.
      
      2.  *Scan your body.* Where is there tension? Ease? Numbness?
      
      3.  *Ask yourself:*
          - "What shadow showed up today?"
          - "What part of me was reacting?"
          - "What do I need right now?"
      
      4.  *Place your hand where you need it most* (heart, belly, forehead).
      
      5.  *Say:*
      
      #align(center)[
        _"I see you.
        I accept you.
        We are whole."_
