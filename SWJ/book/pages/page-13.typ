    Before we explore the shadow, let us map where safety already lives in your body.
    
    Close your eyes. Take three slow breaths. Scan your body from head to toe.
    
    Where do you feel *grounded*? Where do you feel *held*? Perhaps it is a warmth in your chest, a heaviness in your legs, or a softness in your belly.

      #v(0.5cm)
      #figure(image("/assets/phase1-somatic.jpg", width: 55%))
      #v(0.5cm)
    ]
    
    *Mark the figure above:*
    - Draw ROOTS where you feel grounded
    - Draw a SEED or COCOON where you feel held
    - Draw THORNS where you feel guarded or tense
    
    This is your safety baseline. Return here whenever the work feels too intense.
