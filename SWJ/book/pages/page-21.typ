    Think of a recent moment when you were intensely triggered by someone. Where did you feel that reaction?

    *Mark the figure above:*
    - Draw LIGHTNING where you felt activation (heat, tension, energy)
    - Draw MIRRORS where you see yourself reflected in the trigger
    - Draw ROOTS where you felt grounded (if at all)
    
    The body's reaction tells you what is truly at stake beneath the surface story.
