    Fear is not your enemy. It is an ancient guardian, designed to keep you alive. The problem is that this guardian often cannot tell the difference between a tiger and a difficult email.
    
    Anxiety lives in the body—specifically in the vagus nerve and the gut-brain axis. When we intellectualize fear, we bypass the body and stay stuck in loops of worry. True transformation requires *feeling* the fear somatically and learning its language.
    
    Move from chronic resistance to embodied resilience by mapping the "gut-brain" connection of your anxiety. Learn to translate fear into a protective dialogue that serves your evolution.
