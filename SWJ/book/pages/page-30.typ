      1.  *Identify the moment before sabotage.* What does it feel like in your body?
      
      2.  *Create a physical anchor.* Choose a small, unusual action:
          - Snap a rubber band on your wrist
          - Stand up and shake your body for 10 seconds
          - Press your feet firmly into the ground
      
      3.  *Practice the interrupt.* When you feel the urge to sabotage, DO the action immediately.
      
      4.  *Replace the story.* Say aloud:
      
      #align(center)[
        _"I see you, Saboteur.
        I thank you for trying to protect me.
        I choose a different path now."_
      ]
