      1.  *Find a physical seed* (a bean, a flower seed, or even a small stone).
      2.  *Hold it in your hand.* Visualize the "Shadow" attribute you identified on the previous pages (e.g., your anger, your fear, your wildness).
      3.  *Pour that energy into the seed.* Imagine it glowing with the power of that shadow.
      4.  *"Plant" it.* You can bury it in the earth, place it in a potted plant, or keep it in a small box on your altar.
      
      As you do this, say aloud:
      
      #align(center)[
        _ "I plant this shadow in the dark soil of my being.
        May it compost into wisdom.
        May it bloom into power." _
