  body_text: [
    To function in the world, we develop a *Persona*—a mask we wear to be loved and accepted. The Persona is made of all the traits we were rewarded for: being "nice," "quiet," "strong," or "smart."
    
    The Shadow is everything else. It is the counter-weight to the Persona.
    
    If your Persona is "The Responsible One," your Shadow likely holds your desire to be wild and reckless. If your Persona is "The Tough Guy," your Shadow holds your tenderness and fear.

    The goal is not to destroy the Persona, but to realize it is just a role you play, not who you truly are.
